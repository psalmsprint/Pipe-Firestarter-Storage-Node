# Introduction

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Pipe Firestarter

**Pipe Firestarter** is a decentralized storage and delivery network ‚Äî think of it as a blockchain-powered alternative to **Google Drive + Cloudflare**.  
Instead of relying on a single company, it distributes files across **independent nodes**, making data **faster, safer, and censorship-resistant**.

---

## üöÄ Key Features
- Built on **Solana**.
- Already stores **1 petabyte** of Solana‚Äôs blockchain history.
- Cuts **validator sync times** by ~30%.
- Upload files or folders with optional **end-to-end encryption**.
- Global content delivery with **low latency**.
- **Community-powered infrastructure** instead of corporations.

---

## üí∞ Payments & Tokenomics
- Payments are made in **$PIPE tokens** (Devnet).  
- **1 PIPE ‚âà 1 GB** of storage.  
- When tokens are **burned for storage**, they are **re-minted** and rewarded to **node operators**.  
- Incentivizes a sustainable ecosystem where the **community runs the infrastructure**.

---

## üåç Why Firestarter?
Firestarter provides developers and users with a **full-stack decentralized alternative** for:
- **Storage**  
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**  
- **Edge compute**  

‚úÖ All at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional providers.
